# FinanceRAG System for Mixed Data Types: Exploring Structured and Unstructured Data Processing
Project work for the course of NLP, MSc at University of Bologna

## üéØ Project Overview

This project explores the capabilities and limitations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems when handling mixed datasets containing both textual and structured (tabular) data. While RAG systems excel at processing unstructured text, they often struggle with numerical and tabular data that require more specific handling and precise context.

## üîç Key Objectives

- Implement and evaluate standard RAG pipelines for document retrieval and ranking
- Develop advanced methodologies for handling both structured and unstructured data
- Leverage generative LLMs for creating insights and interpreting tabular data
- Compare different approaches on mixed datasets
- Evaluate retrieval effectiveness using available labels

## üìä Dataset

The project utilizes the [FinanceRAG dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linq-AI-Research/FinanceRAG), which contains various documents in both purely textual and mixed formats (text + tabular data).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Standard Pipeline
- Implementation of baseline RAG systems
- Standard document retrieval and ranking approaches
- Evaluation of basic performance metrics

### Phase 2: Advanced Methodologies
- Integration of LLM-powered insight generation
- Enhanced tabular data interpretation
- Implementation inspired by [LangChain's multi-vector retriever](https://blog.langchain.dev/semi-structured-multi-modal-rag/)
- Comparative analysis of performance improvements

## üìà Features

- Dual-mode processing for both structured and unstructured data
- LLM-enhanced insight generation
- Advanced embedding techniques for mixed data types
- Comprehensive evaluation framework
- Performance comparison metrics

## üî¨ Evaluation

The project includes a robust evaluation framework leveraging:
- Available labeled data for retrieval accuracy assessment
- Comparative metrics between standard and advanced approaches
- Performance analysis on mixed data types
